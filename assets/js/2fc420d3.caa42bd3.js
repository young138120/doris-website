Similar to aggregate functions, analytic functions also perform calculations on multiple input rows to obtain a data value. The difference is that the analytic function processes the input data within a specific window, rather than grouping calculations by group by. The data within each window can be sorted and grouped using the over() clause. The analytic function computes a single value for each row of the result set, rather than one value per group by grouping. This flexible approach allows the user to add additional columns to the select clause, giving the user more opportunities to reorganize and filter the result set. Analytic functions can only appear in select lists and in the outermost order by clause. During the query process, the analytical function will take effect at the end, that is, after the join, where and group by operations are performed.
