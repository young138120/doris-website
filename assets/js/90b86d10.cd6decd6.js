Furthermore, we can create different users for different business departments and restrict each user from using different resource groups. In order to avoid the use of resource interference between different business parts. For example, there is a business table in the cluster that needs to be shared by all 9 business departments, but it is hoped that resource preemption between different departments can be avoided as much as possible. Then we can create 3 copies of this table and store them in 3 resource groups. Next, we create 9 users for 9 business departments, and limit the use of one resource group for every 3 users.
